# Meeting - week2 - 28.11.2025

#### Agenda 

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback:

- agenda followed the template and was added to the repository in time
- I feel like the points were relatively vague, so the team was not able to prepare for them. While is good to have something like "new concerns?", it is also good to have some points that are really clear
- the expected time for the agenda was 1 hour (you say it is from 13:45 to 14:45), but in practice it took ~45 minutes. Also, if I sum the time estimates, we get 48 minutes, which is different from both expected and actual


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 

- good amount of notes, and very clear, good job!
- while the minutes contain some agreements with assigned people (chair and minute taker), I don't see anything about who is going to work on what task. These should be added in future minutes


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- all topics were covered, and for a proper amount of time. Everyone was heard during the meeting and the chair listened o input from everyone


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Excellent

Feedback: 

- the team took ownership of the meeting, everyone was active, and the atmosphere was constructive. I don't really have to say anything about this, great job so far, keep up the good work!


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Insufficient

Feedback: 

- no product yet


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback: 

- based on the meeting, it seemed like everyone was working on their stuff. But as I said in the meeting, it would be nice to have this information written in the previous minutes so I can actually check and follow it
- so far, it seems like everyone is contributing equally to the project
