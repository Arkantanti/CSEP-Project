# Meeting - week2 - 21.11.2025

#### Agenda

Quick Summary: Sufficient

Feedback:

- the agenda was there it time, good job
- the agenda followed the template. Watch out, maybe it would be nice to check the rendering before submitting it :). Because of the ```<br>```, it is hard to follow the items
- you can pay more attention to estimates in the future, some of them seem to be slightly off. Also, some things can be merged. For example, announcements from team and TA can be merged into one item (which will still be shorter than your expected time)


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Quick Summary: Insufficient

Feedback: 

- N/A


#### Chair performance

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- the chair ensured all topics were covered. Some of them were slightly shorter than expected, but that is fine, you will learn during the course to better estimate the points
- although I didn't see the chair making sure that everyone was heard, it's not a problem (or at least yet) as everyone seemed to be active in the meeting
- no procedure decided based on Code of Conduct (because there was none) 


#### Attitude & Relation

Quick Summary: Good

Feedback: 

- the team took ownership of the meeting, and it involved everyone in the discussion. The overall atmosphere was constructive, and everyone listened to all ideas, good job so far


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Quick Summary: Insufficient

Feedback: 

- N/A


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Quick Summary: Insufficient

Feedback:
