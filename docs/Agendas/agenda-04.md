The chair opened the meeting exactly on time.

Tomorrow is a member's birthday, and he decided to treat everyone to chocolates.

The chair asked for announcements, but no member had any.

## 4. Approval of the agenda (estimated time: 3 min) - actual time: 1 min
Everyone agreed with the agenda, and no further discussions arose on this subject.

## 5. Announcements by the TA (estimated time: 2 min) - actual time: 7 min
Because of technical issues regarding GitLab, the TA decided to move this point to the end.
At the end of the meeting, he announced the following (and made the following suggestions):
- Minute takers can copy the whole agenda before the meeting and add text in the corresponding sections as the meeting progresses (tip).
- GitLab will enter maintenance from Wednesday 10.12.2025 until (expected) 17.12.2025, so everyone shall clone the project Tuesday evening and add the changes made after the maintenance. As for now, the knockout criteria deadline will remain the same given that we have 2 more days after the site is back up to upload our work.
- The meeting on 19.12.2025 was moved to 18.12.2025, but the date can still change if wanted by the team.
- There will be two buddychecks that each member of the team can complete. One (non-mandatory) in week 5 and one (mandatory) in week 10. Even if the one in week 5 is not mandatory, it is highly recommended. These buddychecks represent anonymous feedback we can provide to each other, namely: TIPS (following the AIDA Model) and TOPS.

## 6. Recap of Friday's meeting + Monday (estimated time: 5 min) - actual time: 5 min
- Finished Checkstyle.
- Everyone did at least one issue.
- Everyone got the mandatory weekly lines except one person who will do so today.

---

## 7. Questions round (estimated time: 10 min) - actual time: 15 min
- The TA cannot tell us our lines of code made in that week, but as a rule of thumb, everything counts excepting comments, JavaFX, and whitespaces. Also, lines of code split into multiple lines, tests, and imports count (no abuse!).
- We also need 600 lines of code in the end, from which at least 300 are server/client.
- Tests are not mandatory for passing, but we need them for a higher grade.
- We decided that we could do the search feature.
- We decided to remove Arthur's merge request, and Anando will finish his MR.
- We decided to keep an ArrayList with the ingredients of each recipe, and this ArrayList will be initialized at the start of the program and updated each time someone adds a new recipe.
- We also decided to make the "add" button also do a refresh of the program.
- We decided to change the interface of the program to be more object-oriented, being this way easier to integrate the ingredients and the recipes.
- We decided we need to make tests for our program. Some tests are harder to implement (i.e., complex tests with mocking), but we can implement those later if we have extra time (TA suggestion).
- We also need controller tests.

## 8. Checking in (estimated time: 5 min) - actual time: 2 min
Everyone did their tasks ('issues') assigned in GitLab.

---

## 9. Planning when to divide the new task (estimated time: 3 min) - actual time: 3 min
On Monday we will have an extra meeting working on the UI, where we will further divide tasks.
We decided that when someone changes the label "priority" of a task to "high," it means that that person needs that task finished in order to be able to start theirs.
